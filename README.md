# elm-ply

An Elm application for loading and view .ply files.

## Future Work
- Use Edgebreaker algorithm to create a *CLERS* string from the input geometry
- Create a total encoding of the input geometry using Edgebreaker
- Be able to load in custom encoding to decompress and display original geometry
- Allow user to download compressed (custom format) and decompressed geometry (ply)
